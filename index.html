  <p>
 A Directed Reading Program is a one-on-one mentoring program in which graduate students mentor
 undergrads in reading projects. Initiated by graduate students in mathematics at the
 Universiy of Chicago in 2003, DRPs now run in mathematics departments at 17 institutions around
 the country. DRPs foster community between graduate
 students and undergraduates, help undergraduates develop vital academic skills and engage with material
 outside of the classroom, and provide graduate students with valuable mentoring experience. For more information, see the webpage of the <a href = "https://www.drp-network.org/"> DRP Network </a>.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is SPA? </h2>

        Our program will run for the first time during Winter Quarter, 2020. We invite students
        from all mathematical, statistical, and personal backgrounds
        to apply. There will be projects catered to various levels of
         statistical experience. For more information about the program goals, see the <a href="https://anna-neufeld.github.io/spa_drp/about.html"> about </a> page.

<h3> Program Goals</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Build community between undergraduates and graduates in the University of Washington department of
statistics. </li>
<li> Provide undergraduates with opportunities to engage with statistics outside of the traditional
curriculum </li>
<li> Provide undergraduates with valuable independent learning and communication skills. </li>
<li> Encourage undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to explore statistics. </li>
<li> Provide graduate students with mentoring opportunities </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3> Intended Audience </h3>
<p>
  Currently, UW undergraduates who enjoy their introductory statistics courses may need to
  wait many quarters before taking additional statistics courses. We would like to provide opportunities
  for these students to continue with statistics during this break and not lose momentum. Therefore, we hope that
  many of our projects will be accessible to students who have completed only Stat 311 or an equivalent. Stat 311
  is a course where students should learn the basics of statistical literacy, probability, and inference.
  We understand that many mentors may want to mentor undergraduates in projects that require more prerequisites
  than this. Some mentors may specify additional prerequisites for their topic, such as Linear Algebra, CSE 142/143,
  or Stat 340.
 </p>
<h3> Program Structure</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Mentor chooses broad topic in statistics and a set of related readings that are accessible to undergraduates </li>
<li> Mentor and mentee meet for 1 hour per week during the 10 week quarter to discuss readings. </li>
<li> Aroung week 6, mentor and mentee transition from reading broad texts to focusing on a specific project
that interests the mentee. The mentee begins planning a final talk and writeup, with feedback
from the mentor. </li>
<li> Last week of quarter- All mentors and all mentees attend final presentation session and pizza party. </li>
</ul>
