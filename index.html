  <p>
 A Directed Reading Program is a one-on-one mentoring program in which graduate students mentor
 undergrads in reading projects. Initiated by graduate students in mathematics at the
 Universiy of Chicago in 2003, DRPs now run in mathematics departments at 17 institutions around
 the country. DRPs foster community between graduate
 students and undergraduates, help undergraduates develop vital academic skills and engage with material
 outside of the classroom, and provide graduate students with valuable mentoring experience. For more information, see the webpage of the <a href = "https://www.drp-network.org/"> DRP Network </a>.

        Our program will run for the first time during Winter Quarter, 2020. We invite students
        from all mathematical, statistical, and personal backgrounds
        to apply. The main function of the directed reading program is to introduce undergraduate students
         to statistics outside of the classroom environment and help them gain skills in
         critically reading statistical texts and communicating statistical material.
         These skills can be gained in various ways, and there will be projects catered to various levels of
         statistical experience. For more information about the program goals, see the <a href="https://anna-neufeld.github.io/spa_drp/about.html"> about </a> page.
