  <p class="lead">
  Welcome to the homepage for the Directed Reading program of the <a href = "http://students.washington.edu/spassc/">Statistics and Probability Association</a>
  at the University of Washington. A Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduates with graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study projects.
  After an initial succesful program in mathematics was piloted at the University of Chicago in 2003, programs with this mission have been started at a variety of Universities, usually in mathematics departments.
  Our program at UW, intended for students with a budding interest in statistics, will run for the first time in Winter, 2020.
