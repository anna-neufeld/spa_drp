  <p class="lead">
  Welcome to the homepage for the Directed Reading program of the <a href = "http://students.washington.edu/spassc/">Statistics and Probability Association</a>
  at the University of Washington. A Directed Reading Program (DRP) pairs undergraduates with graduate student mentors for semester-long independent study projects.
  After an initial succesful program in mathematics was piloted at the University of Chicago in 2003, programs with this mission have been started at a variety of Universities, usually in mathematics departments.
  Our program at UW, intended for students with a budding interest in statistics, will run for the first time in Winter, 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the program is to increase the sense of community between graduate students and undergraduate students in the department at University of Washington, to give graduate Students
    valuable mentoring experience, and to allow undergraduates to explore exciting topics in statistics prior to completeing core coursework.

  <h3> Who should apply? </h3>
  <h3> How to apply? </h3>
  <h3> What should I expect? </h3>
  As an undergraduate, you should expect to commit around 4 hours per week to independent reading related to your project.
  You are required to meet with your graduate mentor once a week for an hour, and at the end of the quarter
  you will complete a writeup of your project and you will give a 10 minute presentation to the other participants.
  <h3> What types of projects? </h3>
