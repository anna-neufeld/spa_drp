  <p class="lead">
  Welcome to the homepage for the Directed Reading program of the <a href = "http://students.washington.edu/spassc/">Statistics and Probability Association</a>
  (SPA) at the University of Washington.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is a DRP? </h2>
  <p>
 A Directed Reading Program is a one-on-one mentoring program in which graduate students mentor
 undergrads in reading projects. Initiated by graduate students in mathematics at the
 Universiy of Chicago in 2003, DRPs now run in mathematics departments at 17 institutions around
 the country. For more information, see the webpage of the <a href = "https://www.drp-network.org/"> DRP Network </a>.

  <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is the SPA DRP? </h2>
  <p>
    SPA is the undergraduate Statistics and Probability Association at the University of Washington. Our program,
    which will match undergraduates with PhD students in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington,
  will run for the first time during Winter Quarter, 2020.

<h2 class="featurette-heading"> Program Goals </h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Build community between undergraduates and graduates in the University of Washington department of
statistics. </li>
<li> Provide undergraduates with opportunities to engage with statistics outside of the traditional
curriculum </li>
<li> Provide undergraduates with valuable independent learning and communication skills. </li>
<li> Encourage undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to explore statistics. </li>
<li> Provide graduate students with mentoring opportunities </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 class="featurette-heading"> Intended Audience </h2>
<p>
  We invite students
    from all mathematical, statistical, and personal backgrounds
    to apply. There will be projects catered to various levels of
    statistical experience, and you do not need to be a statistics major to apply to our program.
 We hope that many of our projects will be accessible to students who have completed only Stat 311 or an equivalent. Stat 311
  is a course where students should learn the basics of statistical literacy, probability, and inference.
   Some mentors may specify additional prerequisites for their topic, such as Linear Algebra, CSE 142/143,
  or Stat 340.

<h2 class="featurette-heading"> Program Structure </h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li> Mentor chooses broad topic in statistics and a set of related readings that are accessible to undergraduates. </li>
<li> Mentor and mentee meet for 1 hour per week during the 10 week quarter to discuss readings. Undergraduates
are expected to spend 3-4 hours per week preparing for these meetings. </li>
<li> Midway through the quarter, mentor and mentee transition from reading broad texts to focusing on a specific project
that interests the mentee. The mentee begins planning a final talk and writeup with feedback
from the mentor. </li>
<li> During the last week of quarter all mentors and all mentees attend final presentation session
   and celebration / pizza party. </li>
</ul>
