  <h2 class="featurette-heading">Winter 2020, Mentors and Projects: </h2>
  <p> The following projects are available in Winter 2020. </p>
  <h4> Kristof Glauninger: Nonparametric Regression </h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Familiarity with linear regression and basic probability, comfort with algebra, some calculus
</i> </li>
<li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Nonparametric statistical methods
  have seen an explosion in popularity as datasets have increased in size and complexity.
  The goal of this project will be to introduce students who are familiar with parametric regression
  models to a nonparametric setting. We will explore some of the basic theory and applications of these models,
  as well as an interesting case where we can achieve parametric convergence rates in a nonparametric setting.

  <h4>Zhaoqi Li</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites</i> Some familiarity of basic statistical background
        and probability theory in the level of STAT 311;
        some knowledge of Maximum Likelihood Estimation is preferred;
        some familiarity of basic programming is preferred;
         an enthusiasm of reading and experimenting is encouraged.  </li>
         <li> We will discuss the relationship between statistics and machine learning, one of the most popular fields in the world,
           and how statistical techniques could be used in the machine learning framework.
            Topics may include classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes),
             training (what is training and the relation to likelihood inference), etc.
           The design could range from experimental to theoretical,
           depending on the background of the student. </li>

  <h4>Shane Lubold:</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>Hi!!!:</i> Hello!!! </li>
  </p>
  <h4>Bryan Martin</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>Hi!!!:</i> Hello!!! </li>
  </p>
  <h4>Zhen Miao:</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>Hi!!!:</i> Hello!!! </li>
  </p>
<h4>Anna Neufeld</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>Please add project</i> A project</li>

<h4>Johnny Paige: Working with Spatial Data</h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites </i> Probability at the level of STAT 340. MATH 308 or some background in linear algebra, and some programming experience (R language strongly recommended). </li>
    <li> Classical methods in statistics such as regression either assume data is independent of each other or their correlation structure is already known.  Yet datasets in climatology, forestry, demography, epidemiology, astronomy, and other areas of study exhibit signs of spatial correlation—nearby observations tend to be more similar. Spatial statistics is the study of such data: how can we “borrow strength” from nearby observations to make predictions at entirely new locations? How can we estimate the correlation structures exhibited by the data, and better determine how underlying natural processes affect our observations? In this project, we will explore how to model data that is correlated in space, and use them to make spatial predictions. The specific project is flexible, depending on your interests and background.
    </li>

<h4>Anupreet Porwal: Bayesian Linear regression and applications </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i>Prerequisites: </i> Basic knowledge of probability distributions at the level of
      Stat 394 or Stat 340. Knowledge of Linear Algebra is essential for this project. Familiarity with a programming language may be helpful.</li>
      <li> Often when we fit models to practical applications, we have some prior understanding of the context of the problem/field which could potentially be useful to tune our model along with the data. For example, if you are trying to model the reply times of emails from dept. chair to professors, information about the designation of professors (full-time/assistant) can be helpful information.
Bayesian statistics provides a formal way to incorporate our prior beliefs and information into the model and is particularly useful as it accurately helps to quantify the uncertainty in our inferences. In this project, we wish to discuss basics of Bayes theorem, Bayesian version of Linear regression and if time permits, we will learn about probabilistic matrix factorization (Recommendation systems) and apply these techniques to an interesting problem.</li>

<h4>Sarah Teichman: Networks </h4>
<p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
    <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> Stat 311. Some R is useful
    but not required. </li>
    <li> Most of the data that you see in STAT 311 are assumed to be independent.
      However, a lot of interesting datasets include information about individual observations
      and the relationships between them. This type of data can be analyzed as networks, in which nodes
      represent individuals and edges represent relationships between them.
       Networks can be used to study interactions between social groups,
        the spread of contagious diseases, biological cycles, etc.
We will use the textbook "Statistical Analysis of Network Data," along with it's companion text
 "Statistical Analysis of Network Data in R" by Eric D. Kolaczyk. We will additionally read one or
  two papers about an application of network analysis and/or analyze a small
  network in R (based on interest of the student). </li>
