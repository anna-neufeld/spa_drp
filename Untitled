  <p>
  <h3> Program Goals</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Build community between undergraduates and graduates in the University of Washington department of
  statistics. </li>
  <li> Provide undergraduates with opportunities to engage with statistics outside of the traditional
  curriculum </li>
  <li> Due to UW's major application process, UW undergraduates who feel inspired by their introductory statistics courses sometimes must
  wait many quarters before taking additional statistics courses. We would like to provide opportunities
  for these students to continue with statistics during this break and not lose momentum. </li>
  <li> Encourage undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to explore statistics. </li>
  <li> Provide graduate students with mentoring opportunities </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
