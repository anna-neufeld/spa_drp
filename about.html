  <p>
  <h3> Program Goals</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Build community between undergraduates and graduates in the University of Washington department of
  statistics. </li>
  <li> Provide undergraduates with opportunities to engage with statistics outside of the traditional
  curriculum </li>
  <li> Provide undergraduates with valuable independent learning and communication skills. </li>
  <li> Encourage undergraduates from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds to explore statistics. </li>
  <li> Provide graduate students with mentoring opportunities </li>
  <li> From the DRP Network Website: By giving undergraduates individual attention, and by focusing on reading rather than research, the Directed Reading Program Network provides opportunities for fundamental skill-building. Further, the program organizers strongly believe that the work conducted within DRPs can help mitigate mechanisms that promote long-standing stigmas- especially those surrounding underrepresented groups in mathematics- that are often triggered in traditional classroom settings.  </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3> Intended Audience </h3>
  <p>
    Due to UW's major application process, UW undergraduates who feel inspired by their introductory statistics courses sometimes must
    wait many quarters before taking additional statistics courses. We would like to provide opportunities
    for these students to continue with statistics during this break and not lose momentum. Therefore, we hope that
    many of our projects will be accessible to students who have completed only Stat 311 or an equivalent. Stat 311
    is a course where students should learn basic statistical literacy, basic probability, and inference including
    confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Students also see a small amount of R programming in Stat 311.
    We understand that many mentors may want to mentor undergraduates in projects that require more prerequisites
    than this. Some mentors may specify additional prerequisites for their topic, such as Linear Algebra, CSE 142/143,
    or Stat 340.
   </p>
  <h3> Program Structure</h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
<li> First week of quarter- 1 hour training session for mentors through the Center for Teaching and learning </li>
<li> Weeks 1-10 of quarter: 1 hour meeting between mentee and mentor each week. Mentor provides structure or reading
materials, </li>
<li> Last week of quarter- All mentors and all mentees attend final presentation session. </li>
  </ul>
</p>
  <h3> Example of Project Format </h3>
  <p>
  <ul>
  <li> Mentor chooses broad topic in statistics that can be accessible to someone with an intro statistics
  background. </li>
  <li> Mentor selects introductory text in the topic that is accessible to student, as well as a few
  accessible application papers. </li>
  <li> First half of quarter: undergraduate reads the text and meets with mentor once a week to discuss questions and interesting
  points. </li>
  <li> Middle of quarter: undergraduate looks independently for additional literature related to the topic and comes
  up with an idea for a final project. </li>
  <li> Last few weeks: undergraduate plans and completes an applied project to present on (i.e. applied the
    method that they studied to a real dataset.  </li>
  </ul>
